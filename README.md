It has been suggested that the memory trace required in Working-memory could be maintained by Calcium-mediated synaptic facilitation - whereby the initial stimulus produces short-term increases in synaptic efficacy that shape the network response to subsequent stimuli. Here, we aim to establish whether this mechanism could support the role of hippocampus in sequential learning. Specifically, we model short-term synaptic plasticity at the CA3-CA1 Schaffer collaterals within the hippocampus during a sequential learning task. 

In this task, the agent must learn to discriminate the sequential presentation of stimuli A and B, separated by a delay of several seconds, with reward; while the sequential presentation of stimuli A and then B is not rewarded. A multi-layer perceptron is trained on CA1 network activity during presentation of the second stimulus, and demonstrate that short-term plasticity at the CA3 inputs leads to a differential response according to stimulus order.
