Code aiming to replicate Figs 1 and 2 of Mongillo 2008 a Synaptic theory of Working Memory Paper: 
Upon spiking Calcuim increases, and decays at a slower rate than the synaptic materials which have been depleted replenish. 
This allows for a Calcium mediated facilitatory period, in which a trace of previuos input can be held within a neural network without sustained spiking. 

This basic model has been replicated here, and addapted to a network of CA3 input to CA1, the output of which is used is the input layer to a 
perceptron, with a single ouput neuron with binary activation, representing either "reward" or "no-reward".
