Caclium facilitation is modelled in CA3 to CA1 projections (Schaffer collaterals). 
Output from CA1 cells is then used to train both single layer and multilayer perceptrons, to model learning of a sequential task over time. 
Perceptron_training_db contains code to plot a single simulation of two odours presented, and generate the data seen in 'Simulated_data', and plot figures seen in 'Figures' folders.
