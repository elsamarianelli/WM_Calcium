Caclium facilitation is modelled in CA3 to CA1 projections (Schaffer collaterals). 
Output from CA1 cells is then used to train both single layer and multilayer perceptrons, to model learning of a sequential task over time. 
Code to generate and plot key figures can be run from the file Perceptron_training_db.
