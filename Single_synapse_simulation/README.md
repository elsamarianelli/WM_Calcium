Code aiming to replicate Figs 1 and 2 of Mongillo 2008 a Synaptic theory of Working Memory Paper: Upon spiking Calcuim increases, and decays at a slower rate than the synaptic materials which have been depleted replenish. This allows for a Calcium mediated facilitatory period, in which a trace of previuos input can be held within a neural network without sustained spiking. The recurrent aspect of the network has been removed in this version.
